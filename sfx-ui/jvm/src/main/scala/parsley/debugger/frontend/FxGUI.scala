/** ScalaFX (on JavaFX) renderer for debug trees. This frontend provides interactive visuals to explore the parse /
  * debug tree of a parser.
  *
  * Nodes can be expanded for information or moved around in order to re-organise them, and a live input display will
  * show what part of the input a parser has tried to parse when its respective node is selected.
  *
  * The primary mouse button (left-click for most users) is used to select nodes to show the parsed input for that node
  * and possibly its result.
  *
  * The secondary mouse button (right-click for most users) is used to fold or unfold nodes on the tree. It is possible
  * to fold both individual parser nodes (the red / green rectangles) and the named nodes (names on dotted borders).
  *
  * The Unfold All / Fold All buttons are relatively self-explanatory, as for the zoom bar located above said buttons.
  *
  * On the side of the window away from the tree display, a node info display and parse input display can be found. The
  * node info display shows more information about a parse attempt (its offsets, result, etc.) and the input display
  * shows where in the input the parse attempt was made, highlighted in bold, green, and underlined text within the rest
  * of the input.
  *
  * It is recommended that all memory-heavy types (e.g. closures) are not stored explicitly. Consult the documentation
  * on attaching debuggers to find out how to prevent that.
